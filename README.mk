android-ng
===========

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android-ng, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
gh repo clone -u https://github.com/android-ng/android.git -u lineage-20.0 android-chat.de
```

Please see the [android-ng Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions, by device.


Submitting patches
------------------
Patches are always welcome! Please submit your patches via android-ng Gerrit!

Simply follow our guide on [how to submit patches](https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting-patch-howto.html).

To view the status of your and others' patches, visit [android-ng Gerrit Code Review](https://review.lineageos.org/).


Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built weekly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.

You can view the current build statuses at [android-ng Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/lineageos).

Builds produced weekly by the buildbot can be downloaded from [android-ng downloads](https://download.lineageos.org/).
